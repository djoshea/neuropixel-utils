# Acknowledgements

## Neuropixels and Kilosort

Many of the core ideas and data structures used in these utilities are reorganized versions of existing code, and I am very grateful for the authors who have written, documented, and released their code open source to the community. These sources include:

* Harris+Carandini Cortex Lab [spikes repo](https://github.com/cortex-lab/spikes)

* Harris+Carandini Cortex Lab [neuropixels wiki](https://github.com/cortex-lab/neuropixels/wiki)

* [Kilosort](https://github.com/cortex-lab/KiloSort)

* [Kilosort2](https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort2)

* [Phy](https://github.com/kwikteam/phy) and [phy-contrib](https://github.com/kwikteam/phy-contrib)

In particular, I'd like to acknowledge [Nick Steinmetz](http://www.nicksteinmetz.com/) and [Marius Pachitariu](https://www.janelia.org/people/marius-pachitariu) for Neuropixel and Kilosort related resources they've provided to the community.

## Packaged external dependencies

I'd also like to acknowledge several authors whose Matlab File Exchange contributions are included within neuropixel-utils. Because Matlab doesn't have any useful dependency management system, I find it easier to simply include these contributions directly rather than asking users to download multiple dependencies by hand. These files are licensed as described in the files.

## Matlab coding

Neuropixel Utils' repo organization and packaging system is based on [Janklab's](https://janklab.net) [MatlabProjectTemplate](https://matlabprojecttemplate.janklab.net/) structure, adapted with financial support from MathWorks.

## Support

If you have any issues using this code with your data, please look for any similar [existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/djoshea/neuropixel-utils/issues) or file a new issue there. Please don't email me straight away unless there's some need for confidentiality, as I'll most likely ask you to file a GitHub issue anyway. Across multiple repositiories, this policy helps me keep track of what needs to be fixed, and also helps other users who may have been encountering similar issues.

Thanks!
